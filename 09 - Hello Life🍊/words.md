不要忘记你的初心。

《words》( https://justinjackson.ca/words.html ) - Justin Jackson

# This is a web page.

There's not much here.

Just words.

**And you're reading them.**

We've become obsessed with fancy designs, responsive layouts, and scripts that do magical things.

**But the most powerful tool on the web is still words.**

I wrote these words, and you're reading them: _that's_ magical.

I'm in a little city in British Columbia; you're probably somewhere else. I wrote this early in the morning, June 20th, 2013; you're reading it at a different time. I wrote this on my laptop; you could be reading this on your phone, a tablet or a desktop.

You and I have been able to connect because _I wrote this_ and _you're reading it._ **That's the web**. Despite our different locations, devices, and time-zones we can connect _here,_ on a simple HTML page.

I wrote this in a text editor. It's 6 kB. I didn't need a Content Management System, a graphic designer, or a software developer. There's not much code on this page at all: just simple markup for paragraphs, hierarchy, and emphasis.

I remember teaching my daughter to code HTML when she was 8. The first thing she wrote was [a story about a squirrel](https://justinjackson.ca/squirrel). She wasn't "writing HTML"; **she was sharing something with the world**. She couldn't believe that she could write a story on our home computer, and then publish it for the world to see. She didn't care about HTML; she cared about sharing her stories.

**You are still reading.**

Think about all the things you could communicate with a simple page like this. If you're a businessperson, you could sell something. If you're a teacher, you could teach something. If you're an artist, you could show something you've made. **And if your words are good, people will read them.**

If you're a web designer, I challenge you to think about the words first. Instead of starting with a style guide or a Photoshop mockup, _start with words on a page_.

What do you have to say? If you don't know, there's not much use in adding all that other cruft. **Just start with one page**, with a single focus. Write it and publish it, and then _iterate on that_. Every time you're about to add something, ask yourself: does this help me communicate better? Will that additional styling, image, or hyperlink give my audience more understanding? If the answer is "no," don't add it.

**At its heart, web design should be about words**. Words don't come _after_ the design is done. Words are the beginning, the core, the focus.

Start with words.

Cheers,
